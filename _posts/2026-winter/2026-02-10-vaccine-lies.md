> "We have advocated for measles vaccines all along"

I wonder how many people find it possible to believe that.


If you read this or heard this and you thought "I must be taking crazy pills!" -- no, you aren't. 


I put together an interactive slide show with references to a bunch of times Trump administration officials have undermined vaccination, including measles. They may want you to believe they've always been clear in their support of certain vaccines vs. others, but the truth is far from that. See for yourself. Any recent pro‑MMR statements sit alongside years of anti‑vaccine messaging and policy changes that have weakened vaccine systems and fueled hesitancy about measles vaccination.

Full references with links can be found on slide 16. Slide 17 highlights recent statements that the record contradicts. Slides 1-15 are separate categories with instances of the undermining of vaccines.
