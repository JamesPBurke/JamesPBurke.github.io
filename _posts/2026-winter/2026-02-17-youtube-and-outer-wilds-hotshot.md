Apologies in advance that this post is a bit of a ride. I'm not sure who the audience is, but that's never stopped me before.

Yesterday I uploaded a video I made by recording my attempt to complete an achievement in the video game Outer Wilds. Stick around for my description/plug for this game later in this post. The achievement is called [Hot Shot](https://www.playstationtrophies.org/game/outer-wilds-na/trophy/280598-hotshot.html){:target="_blank"}, and to receive the achievement you have to fly to a place that is very close to the Sun and enter a structure.

You fly to the Sun Station, a location that is very important later in the game, but is largely a mystery early in the game.

This is one of the hardest achievements in the game because of the difficulty of coordinating your velocity components in at least three dimensions with no computer assist under changing gravitational conditions. For the purposes of completing the game, this is absolutely unnecessary. The game creators knew people might want to try this, so they created an achievement trophy to mark that you had done it. 

I spent about a day and a half of trying to complete this achievement. Over 70 attempts. And that's after I tried a number of times less seriously in the many hours we played the game before completing the main story arc. I did watch a couple of YouTube videos that tried to explain what you could do to make the achievement easier, but while they made the achievement *look* easy, the useful advice was minimal[^1]. But after so many attempts, and Kit's patient encouragement, we pushed through and did it. You can watch the 3.5 minute video above, to which I've added a soundtrack from the YouTube free music library of [a Grieg piece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLp_Hh6DKWc){:target="_blank"} I've known since music teachers introduced us to it in elementary school. The video may 

## Why? ##

Why do this? Good question. Why do anything? If that seems like a cop out answer, it is. But people only ever ask the question when they already think what you're doing is a waste of time. People rarely ask why you ate breakfast. Or tied your shoes. They didn't fail to ask because they *knew why* you did those thing; they failed to ask because they knew why you did those things and *didn't* think they were a waste of time. People do know why other people play video games: it's for entertainment. What they're really asking is "why do you find that entertaining, when I think it might be a waste of time?"

## Cooper, This is no time for caution ##

One thing I like about the Hot Shot achievement highlights a reason that there is heavy overlap between fans of Outer Wilds and fans of the Christopher Nolan film *Interstellar*. 

There is a scene in *Interstellar*  that features a risky docking operation. If you *haven't* seen Interstellar, please see it. It isn't a perfect film, but it's got action, and drama, and mind-bending science fiction, and might make you cry if you have a pulse. Whether you like it or not, I am going to guess you won't feel neutral. Fans of Outer Wilds have likened the Hot Shot achievement to that scene in Interstellar where Cooper is trying to perform a dangerous docking 

## What is Outer Wilds and Why You Should Play It If You Like Fun

Outer Wilds is a space exploration mystery puzzle game. It's one of the best, most compelling video games I've ever played. This is the kind of game I like.

You are a hatchling in a community of explorers on a planet (Timber Hearth) that has begun to explore its solar system and the extinct civilization of scientists (the three-eyed goat-like Nomai) who previously inhabited it. You are cleared to become the next explorer, and have been given a ship. You begin to unravel the mystery of what the Nomai were up to, equipped with the very latest equipment your fellow Hearthians can provide.

You will learn to fly a janky ship with a flawed autopilot. You'll learn to spacewalk. You will fight intense gravity wells and claw your way back to safety when you are running out of oxygen. You will make wonderful, terrible discoveries.

Two other interesting things to know about this game:

1. little to nothing is "stored" in the save files. Nearly everything that changes as you play is happening in your head and memory (apart from your ship's log). No change you make in the world persists (for long). You are unraveling a mystery by uncovering it, not building or making things.
2. You are playing within a clockwork universe ruled by (Newtonian) physics. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction; flying full speed toward a planet means spending just as long with your thrusters in reverse. When the moon is overhead, you are ever so slightly lighter. Get caught in the Sun's gravity and you're probably going to burn up. It presents interesting flight challenges and opportunities.

I'm not inking you anywhere other than the [Outer Wilds Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/) because spoilers will ruin this game for you. Because all progress is in what you know. The Outer Wilds community online are very protective of newcomers because spoilers are so 

[^1]: An exception was [the video by MrGuybrush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLHShjNtneo){:target="_blank"}. While he says he can do the achievement 100% of the time and that it's now easy for him, I think he's underestimating the skill he's gained through practice. But his guide did recommend some tips on orienting your ship that were very useful to get me close.
