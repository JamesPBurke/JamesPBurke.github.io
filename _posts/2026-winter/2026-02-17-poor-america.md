"Poor America"[^1]

Neither you, Bondi, nor the fifty thousand,  
Nor the markets, nor the polls,  
Nor the donors, nor the base,  
Nor the courts, nor the laws,  
Nor doomed America itself  
Understand what freedom is,  
Understand democracy,  
Understand at all,  
Understand at all.  

If you faced all that we know,  
poor America,  
You'd see the harm, but you'd close your eyes.  
But you close your eyes.  

While stocks rise,  
freedoms are burning, poor America.  
To serve one man, you have to die inside.  
You have to die inside.
