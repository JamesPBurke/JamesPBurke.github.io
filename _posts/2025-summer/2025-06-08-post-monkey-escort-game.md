![Gameplay from Monkey Escort Mission](https://ik.imagekit.io/scurryday/thumb/escort_gameplay.gif?tr=w-640)

I teach a game creation class at the high school, and one of the platforms we use is [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/). I've [written about it before]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#makecode). Students have really enjoyed this platform, especially this year. I actually diverted away from other projects to give kids more time on MakeCode because of the enthusiasm they had for it. Next year I plan to feature it earlier and more prominently in the curriculum.

As a result, I've returned to it to flesh out a game that can be used as an example for several projects next year, covering a number of the features of the platform. The result of my recent work is Monkey Escort Mission. [You can play it here](https://jamespburke.com/monkey-escort-mission).

At various points in projects, my students are directed to create their games with things like:

* A story
* Characters
* Interesting game mechanics
* Goals and win conditions
* Obstacles to overcome before a goal can be reached
* Assets
  * Sprites
  * Sounds
  * Music
* Multiplayer support
* Progressive difficulty increases
* Cooperative play
* Instructions

I've built the instructions into my game, so you can play it to read those.

Here's the story:

> You have been tasked as the guardian of the Monkey King's son. Prince Monkleton is very young and prone to wandering. He excels at sneaking off, and also speeding off when he gets it in his mind to wander. On one of his treks, he accidentally crossed over into the Ghost Domain, a region of lawless mercenaries who employ dark magic to plunder and swindle their way to riches.
>
>The Ghosts used magic to imprison Monkleton in their maze. Buy you aren't without your own tricks. You teleported to the side of the prince in order to help him escape. But you can't teleport out unless you get to the golden area of the maze. Once there, you can use an incantation to free yourself and the prince.
>
>Avoid the Ghosts, who will simply teleport you back to your holding area.
>
>Good luck!

You can play the game on a computer, or on a phone or tablet. On a computer the arrow keys (or WASD) will move the player. The space bar is the A key, and fires projectiles. On a phone or tablet there is an on-screen joystick as well as buttons. It's easier on a computer, though. 

Have fun! And let me know what you think. I know it's not a triple-A game, but I only write it with time cobbled together over a couple of days.
