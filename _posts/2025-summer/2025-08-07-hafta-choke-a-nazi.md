When I think of American heroes punching Nazis, I think of Superman, Captain America, and (in my lifetime) Indiana Jones. At the time the Indiana Jones movies were targeting fascists, I didn't perceive it being particularly controversial.

But to accept all three of these examples as expressions of *popular* American sentiment and patriotism is historical revisionism. In the 70's and early 80's, I grew up learning that Nazis were an existential threat to the free world who were defeated at great cost. These were the villains of my grandparents' generation, and by the time I came around, other villains were being pushed by my parents' generation, and Nazis had become almost cartoonish. It was certainly OK to cast them as your villains. Safe.[^1]

But were they always that way?

Last night I watched a video essay in which a comic fan dismantled a niche conservative media critic's takedown of the recent Superman film from the perspective of a comic fan (as opposed to a political perspective). The YouTuber claimed that Superman's willingness to intervene against Hitler preceded America's. Not one to just accept things I see in videos at face value, I decided to dig a bit and provide you with some points. I'm going to list supporting facts for the following claim:

Superman was portrayed as opposing Hitler in February of 1940 in a story where he captures and turns the Nazi over for the world's judgment. He expresses a desire to do violence to the man, but refrains. At the time, this was an unpopular position to the point that the creator got death threats and were accused of brainwashing young children to become empathetic.

In **February of 1940**, Look Magazine commissioned a comic story from the creators of Superman called "How Superman Would End the War."

Most AI image generation services would not let me create this image. Make of that what you will." %}
The [entire comic is available here on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/HowSupermanWouldEndTheWar/mode/2up), if you'd like to read it for yourself. The editor wrote:

> SIEGEL AND SHUSTER GAVE SUPERMAN A BIG JOB in this episode, when they assigned him to solve the international situation just for Look. But such tasks are nothing new for him. He once stopped a war "somewhere in South America" by dumping a munitions profiteer into Ihe trenches for a dose of his own medicine. On another occasion he plucked two opposing generals from their tents and told them to settle their differences with bare fists. They knew no "differences," shook hands and made peace.

This establishes the way Superman was portrayed and the time in which this portrayal existed.

The [National WWII Museum of History New Orleans notes](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/great-debate) that isolationist sentiment was strong in 1940, influenced by the horrors of the first world war, in which we lost hundreds of thousands of American lives. They detail just how unpopular the idea of intervening in Europe was at the time the Superman vs. Hitler story was published.

> Public opinion polling was still in its infancy as World War II approached, but surveys suggested the force of events in Europe in 1940 had a powerful impact on American ideas about the war. In January of that year, one poll found that 88% of Americans opposed the idea of declaring war against the Axis powers in Europe. As late as June, only 35% of Americans believed their government should risk war to help the British.

This establishes that Superman was not acting as Americans thought the country ought to act.

One direct reaction to the comic came in the form of *Das schwarze Korps*, 25 April 1940, an issue of the newspaper for the Nazi SS. You can [see the article](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/superman.htm) in a [Calvin University Nazi propaganda archive](https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/index.htm). The article which harshly criticized the creators of Superman was written by [Joseph Goebbels, Nazi Propagandist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels) and a sort of non-Temu 1930's version of Stephen Miller. The SS claimed American children were being brainwashed into the wrong values by Jerry Siegel. The SS wrote:

> "He cries “Strength! Courage! Justice!” to the noble yearnings of American children. Instead of using the chance to encourage really useful virtues, he sows hate, suspicion, evil, laziness, and criminality in their young hearts. Jerry Siegellack[^2] stinks. Woe to the American youth, who must live in such a poisoned atmosphere and don’t even notice the poison they swallow daily.

So, at least the Nazis didn't like it. It is quite remarkable that they had such a reaction. Superman was not the icon he is today. But perhaps Goebbels was concerned about the possibility of American isolationism changing. Which it did slowly, and then dramatically.

Several sources claim that Nazi sympathizers like the [German American Bund](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/german-american-bund) picketed the comic book offices and sent death threats and other hate mail to the company that would eventually become DC Comics. However, I was only able to turn up indirect sources for these claims, and no contemporary ones.

You can read along those lines at the following links:

* [Snopes details on the Nazi Response](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nazi-newspaper-superman/)
* IGN's [story about the general phenomenon of superheroes vs. Nazis makes the Bund hate mail claim.](https://www.ign.com/articles/punching-nazis-how-wwii-superheroes-were-used-as-propaganda)
* The Comic Book Legal Defense Fund make the claim in [their story about censor Fredrick Wertham](https://cbldf.org/2012/09/the-amazing-adventure-of-the-man-of-steel-and-the-psychiatric-censor-superman-vs-doctor-wertham/) and his efforts to claim that Superman was the one who was the fascist Nazi. Wild stuff.
* And then [here's an article I found too late to just link to it](https://aish.com/superman-vs-the-nazis/) instead of writing this blog post. Oh well.

I learned a few things. First, that "Superman made Nazis angry" was a story I completely missed in social media over the last few weeks, but it was prominent enough for there to be a Snopes article.

I also learned that it isn't easy to get image generators like MidJourney to generate images of Hitler or Nazis. Are they simply trying to avoid controversy? Often, censoring these services is done to protect the individuals using them and other people whop might be harmed. But I believe that some of the censoring they've slipped in there is to sidestep complaints, and this sort of censoring protects them, primarily.

I learned that Superman was influential well before the height of his popularity. The story that the Goebbels was upset was widely reported, so not only did the Nazis take notice, but Americans were informed at the time (see the Snopes article linked above).

Something else stood out to me, when I saw how the Nazis had attacked Siegel for promoting the wrong values, I wondered what specific values had the Nazis upset. Just noodling around in searches, I found the following values that Nazis particularly disliked:

* Democratic values and Pluralism: Nazi propaganda attacked American films for promoting what they called "racial mixing" and democratic participation by diverse groups.
* Materialism and Consumer Culture: Nazis had an idea of living more simple Germanic living along with the racial purity they promoted, and this ran counter to the consumer culture of the time.
* Inclusion of Jews in Public Life: Jewish participation in American life was something that, I imagine, they saw as propaganda.
* Women's Independence: Nazis despised the teaching of non-traditional gender roles for women.

Perhaps I didn't need another post about Superman. But before I heard any of this, I assumed that Superman was simply doing what the American people had already embraced.

[^1]: It's wild to think that, now, "communist Soviets" who I might call the villains of my parents' generation are the villains of my freshman students' GREAT grandparents' generation. In other words, the red menace, which was never as visceral or costly as the Nazi threat, are a generation more removed from their lives than the Nazis were from my life.
    
[^2]: Apparently a pun on a name for sealing wax? I have no idea why.
