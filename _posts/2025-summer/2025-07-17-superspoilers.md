## My Exit Thoughts about *Superman*

In trying to get a bit better at writing reviews or reactions to things, I'm going to see if going for a quicker take and a shorter format works. Or, maybe I'll discover this sort of thing isn't for me right now. And because you should write what you know, I'm beginning by writing about the reaction I first had. Maybe this makes this *not* a review. I dunno. Perhaps we'll discover it together.

If you're laughing that this is the second review I'm writing for one movie... sure, make fun of the guy who never gets out of the house. I hope you're happy with yourself. :wink:

My first paragraph is spoiler-dense, so I've hidden it to help unsuspecting people avoid it. But by this time, you should know ***LEAVE OR BE SPOILED***.

## Final Spoiler Warning

James Gunn added a twist to his _Superman_ film. In contrast to some portrayals of Superman, Jor-El and Lara didn't send Kal-El to Earth to help the human race. Instead, he was sent to subjugate Earth in order to create a new Krypton in the wake of the destruction of Krypton. And in case you think they didn't mean it, they doubled down by saying Kal should start a human harem to populate the globe with little part-Kryptonians.

The movie sets you up at its beginning by having Superman listen to the undamaged part of the message when he is recovering from his first losing battle. The message (as Clark interprets it) is a benevolent one of love, setting him up to be a force for good on the planet. We don't hear the full, horrifying version until Lex uses all his resources to recover, then verify the message. This works in Lex's favor, but we have to admit that all he's doing is telling the truth about Superman's origins.

Once you leave the theater, you've seen Superman embrace his upbringing and reject his birthright. I've seen plenty of interpretations of the themes of the film (and shared [my own interpretation of the backlash]({% post_url /2025-summer/2025-07-11-superman %})), I haven't shared my personal reaction to this reversal. The whole thing felt familiar. And I don't mean in a "Darth Vader is actually your father" sort of way.

How many Americans have had the experience of some important person to them, a family member, a childhood friend, or even a place or system suddenly feeling alien to them? The [Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines "alienation"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alienation) as "a withdrawing or separation of a person or a person's affections from an object or position of former attachment." Unless you're a very sheltered American, you must have had an experience learning *something* about American history that you found profoundly disturbing. And there ar enough disturbing things to learn that whole groups of people [object strongly to other people learning these disturbing things](https://thehill.com/changing-america/enrichment/education/581029-nearly-half-of-republicans-polled-say-schools-shouldnt/). We agree the actual history is disturbing, but as Americans we decide to push forward.

I've struggled with the phrase: "this is not what this country is supposed to be about" when considering the news. Some of the ideals I grew up with aren't reflected in the news about my country. Realizing that my fellow Americans may have never had an experience that lives up to those ideals is heartbreaking. The idea of the country that comforted you in your youth is suddenly revealed to have been misrepresented, and misinterpreted. And you were complicit, as you willingly accepted an interpretation colored by your innocence. That is alienating. Disillusioning.

To make this even more personal, how many Americans either dread or avoid holiday dinners because of relatives with views that vex them? Recalling some of the contentious discussions on the half-century-old *All in the Family*, this isn't a new phenomenon. But there is something upsetting that comes with a realization that not only did the country not live up to the ideals you were taught, the people who taught you those ideals maybe never really embraced them in the first place. Maybe your interpretation was missing some key information. That's a whole difficult rug pull to be living through.

I don't necessarily think James Gunn was precisely thinking of any of this when he was making this film. At least, not in the way I'm stating it. "No \[Luke\], I am your father!" didn't make me think these same thoughts. But, then, I hadn't lived through disillusion at the point in my life when I first saw that scene.
