This week I traveled to Westborough to participate in the two-day kickoff of an AI in the Classroom initiative. You can read the state press release about it at the link. AI in educaiton is important enough that there is a mass.gov press release for it, and it's good ot see it getting this attention.

Preparing teachers is one part of the state's plan to address the oncoming changes that will surely take place (they are already taking place) because of the ubiquity of generative and other forms of machine intelligence that are accessible by teachers, students, and parents. I'm honestly not even sure what to call it anymore. "AI" is the term we've settled on, but as plenty of peopel will tell you, that's not a great term. But talking about the different technologies separately, and always trying to explain what we're talking about is also not helpful. So, the best thing, perhaps, is to refer to things as "AI features." Because the industry is calling them AI, and we're mostly talking about features people are being provided with, not how those features were created.

In any case, check out the press release.
