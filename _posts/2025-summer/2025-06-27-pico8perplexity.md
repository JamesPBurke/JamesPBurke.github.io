# **PICO-8 Workshop: A Comprehensive Introduction for Educators**

## **What is PICO-8?**

PICO-8 is a fantasy console developed by Lexaloffle Games that provides an intentionally constrained environment for creating, sharing, and playing small digital games and programs[^1_1]. Unlike traditional game engines that overwhelm newcomers with countless features and possibilities, PICO-8 deliberately embraces limitations to foster creativity and learning[^1_2].

**Core Specifications:**

- **Display**: 128x128 pixels with a fixed 16-color palette[^1_1][^1_3]
- **Sound**: 4-channel audio with 64 definable "chip blerps"[^1_1]
- **Code**: Uses P8 Lua (maximum 8,192 tokens)[^1_1]
- **Cartridge Size**: 32k data capacity stored as special PNG files[^1_1]
- **Sprites**: 256 8x8 sprites available[^1_1]
- **Map**: 128x32 tile map system[^1_1]

The platform feels like a regular console but runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even Raspberry Pi systems[^1_1]. When you boot PICO-8, you're greeted with a command line interface alongside integrated tools for creating code, sprites, maps, sound effects, and music[^1_1]. This all-in-one approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple software packages while maintaining focus on fundamental programming and game design concepts.

PICO-8's "fantasy console" concept means it emulates the aesthetic and constraints of 8-bit systems from the 1980s without being tied to actual historical hardware limitations[^1_2]. This design philosophy encourages developers to focus on core gameplay mechanics rather than getting overwhelmed by modern development complexities[^1_4]. Notable games like the original four-day version of Celeste demonstrate the platform's capability to produce award-winning experiences within its constraints[^1_4].

The unique cartridge format stores games as PNG images that display cover art while containing the complete game code, graphics, and sound data[^1_5][^1_4]. This steganographic approach makes sharing games as simple as sharing an image file, and any cartridge can be reopened in PICO-8 to examine and modify its contents[^1_1].

## **How do educators use PICO-8 in their classrooms?**

Educators worldwide have embraced PICO-8 as an exceptional tool for introducing programming concepts and game development to students. The platform's educational value stems from its ability to make coding approachable while maintaining professional development practices[^1_6][^1_7].

## **Your first PICO-8 project!**

Now it's time to create your first complete PICO-8 project. This hands-on experience will deepen your understanding and prepare you to guide students through similar work.

**Project: Simple Moving Character**
We'll create a basic game featuring a character that moves around the screen using keyboard controls. This project introduces fundamental programming concepts while providing immediate visual feedback.

**Step 1: Setting Up the Project Structure**
Open PICO-8 Education Edition and press Escape to enter the code editor. Create the basic game framework:

```lua
-- My First Game
-- Your Name

function _init()
  -- Player starting position
  px = 64  -- Player X coordinate
  py = 64  -- Player Y coordinate
end

function _update()
  -- Handle player input
  if btn(0) then px -= 1 end  -- Left
  if btn(1) then px += 1 end  -- Right
  if btn(2) then py -= 1 end  -- Up
  if btn(3) then py += 1 end  -- Down
end

function _draw()
  -- Clear screen
  cls()
  
  -- Draw player
  spr(1, px, py)
end
```

**Step 2: Creating Player Sprite**
Switch to the sprite editor (second tab) and design a simple 8x8 pixel character in sprite slot 1. Use different colors from the 16-color palette to make your character distinctive. Even a simple design like a colored square with eyes will work perfectly for this first project[^1_33].

**Step 3: Testing and Iteration**
Return to the console (Escape key) and type `RUN` to test your game. Your character should move in response to arrow key presses. If something doesn't work, check your code for typos—PICO-8 will display error messages to help you debug[^1_32].

**Step 4: Adding Enhancements**
Once basic movement works, add improvements to make your project more engaging:

```lua
function _update()
  -- Handle player input with boundaries
  if btn(0) and px > 0 then px -= 1 end    -- Left with boundary
  if btn(1) and px < 120 then px += 1 end  -- Right with boundary
  if btn(2) and py > 0 then py -= 1 end    -- Up with boundary
  if btn(3) and py < 120 then py += 1 end  -- Down with boundary
end

function _draw()
  -- Clear screen with background color
  cls(1)  -- Dark blue background
  
  -- Draw border
  rect(0, 0, 127, 127, 7)  -- White border
  
  -- Draw player
  spr(1, px, py)
  
  -- Display coordinates
  print("x:" .. px .. " y:" .. py, 2, 2, 7)
end
```

**Step 5: Adding Sound Effects**
Experiment with the sound editor (fourth tab) to create simple sound effects. Add audio feedback to movement:

```lua
function _update()
  local moved = false
  
  if btn(0) and px > 0 then 
    px -= 1 
    moved = true 
  end
  -- ... other directions
  
  if moved then
    sfx(0)  -- Play sound effect 0
  end
end
```

**Step 6: Saving and Sharing**
Save your project using the `SAVE` command. Type `SAVE MYFIRSTGAME` to store your work. You can reload it later with `LOAD MYFIRSTGAME`[^1_32].

**Reflection Questions:**
