My daughter requested this for her birthday, so it motivated me to get the recipe on here for you. Also, you can find [this recipe for Kibbeh on my Cooked.wiki](https://cooked.wiki/saved/b833535c-aff4-428d-bf22-0135a36b5286). 

This is a middle eastern kind of meatloaf. Sometimes it's prepared raw. My family loves it this way. We also like to dump 
a Lebanese salad (recipe coming at some point, [but you could always just watch Bob make it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWyJeMZKuEQ)) on top of this, or next to this, and eat it with syrian bread that has been ripped into bits
to make a "laqma" (لقمة) (enough for a mouthful).

## Instructions

1. **Soak Burghul**

2. **Prepare Kibbeh Mixture**  
   - Finely process 1 onion until pulverized.  
   - In a large bowl, mix together soaked burghul, pulverized onion,  
     `1/2 Tbsp salt`, `1/2 tsp pepper`, `1/2 tsp cinnamon`, and `1/2 tsp allspice`.  
   - Add `1 lb ground beef` and mix thoroughly by hand until fully combined.  
   - Set aside.

3. **Prepare Hashweh (Stuffing)**  
   - Chop the remaining onion.  
   - Sauté chopped onion and `1/4 cup pine nuts` in olive oil until softened.  
   - Add `0.5 lb ground beef`, `1 tsp salt`, `1 tsp pepper`, `1 tsp cinnamon`, and `1 tsp allspice`.  
   - Cook until meat is browned. Set aside.

4. **Assemble**  
   - Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**.  
   - Grease a **9x9-inch baking dish** with olive oil.  
   - Press half the kibbeh meat into the bottom.  
   - Spread the hashweh stuffing evenly.  
   - Flatten the rest of the kibbeh into small patties, place on top, and smooth into an even layer.

5. **Decorate & Bake**  
   - Score the top with a knife in a diagonal crisscross pattern.  
   - Brush with olive oil.  
   - Bake for **45–50 minutes**, until browned and firm.
