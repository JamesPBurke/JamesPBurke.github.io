I think a lot about what friends have said. A lot of times, it's about politics.

Two things that have always puzzled me are the idea of having an identity as a centrist, and the idea of equating both sides of any sort of disagreement in politics, whether it be on an issue, between political parties, or whatever. I have learned, over time, that disagreements come down to a lot of things. You often hear about one of those things, especially from people who want to maintain a sort of impossible balance where sides of an issue are somehow equal in merit. And that thing is *perspective*. I think different perspectives *can* often be resolved when people are willing to listen.

So, are people just not willing to listen to each other, and is that the source of divisions in our US politics? I think that's a naive thing to believe. There are so many assumptions in the idea that "both sides need to come together," not the least of which is that there are two distinct sides. *Sides* itself is a metaphor of physical position, where you can picture two groups of people who could just get along if they would be willing to walk the ground between them and shake hands. But opinions aren't sides. Not really. 

There are opinions in our world today that, if you pictured the land between these imaginary sides, you would see a kind of chasm that would devour one of the groups if they were to try to cross within reach of the other group of people. In other words, some people are arguing for their existence and others are arguing against that existence. If you think my chasm metaphor doesn't work here, I blame the idea of sides as perspectives that can be located in a physical space.

It's not polite to ask people who describe themselves as centrists: "Is centrism an ideology? What are its values?" Is its value politeness? Giving due to the status quo? Supporting dominant power structures in the interest of avoiding being the target of disapproval? 

Just like you, I want to keep my friends. Generally. But, then, I'm also interested in the idea of finding common ground across very large imaginary gulfs. I've spent (wasted?) time watching YouTube debate-bros. They largely focus on the extremes. I'm not interested in looking there for insights anymore. So, what to do?

Here's an interesting (to me) idea. Have Perplexity create a fake roundtable of different opinions on an issue. It has the ability to look up opinions, articles, and other writing. And, to illustrate the idea that there aren't just two sides, the LLM can populate the table with several different people who take different perspectives. The purpose would mainly be to explore perspectives and values expressed int he writing, not to look for a winner. It isn't a debate. But I was curious to see what perspectives would be represented, and what, if anything, they might uncover as a middle ground. For the subject, I used a contentious issue with real impact on US life today: increasing activity and changing tactics of ICE.

Below is the result. It begins with the original prompt I used, in case you're interested. In the interest of brevity, I've left out some prompts from the middle of this exercise, but [you can see the entire prompt history and all the references here](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/i-want-you-to-generate-the-scr-XypdicN.T9u0bxtehxj2lw). What follows is my initial prompt in a notice box, and then the roundtable begins. I have added commentary between the sections in a different-colored notice box. 



<div>I want you to generate the script of a roundtable discussion. The discussion will involve four participants.
You will give a quick profile of each participant at the beginning of the discussion so we know their 
background and general politics. One participant will be a Libertarian. One participant will be a liberal
Democrat. You will choose the remaining two participants by determining what the most interesting voices 
would be that are not represented by the other participants.`

This discussion will be about all of the recent policies, actions, and complaints surrounding ICE ramping up operations in the United States. Mine news stories and anything else for the facts on this subject, concerns, accusations, justifications, etc.
<ul>
<li> Any aspect of ICE activity or its funding is a fair game for this discussion.</li>
<li> Each participant should strive to get their major concerns heard and understood.</li>
<li> While it is not, strictly speaking, a debate, participants should push back on any point they hear that they believe might be weak or inaccurate.</li>
<li> The discussion should continue for as long as it is necessary for each participant to have a chance to flesh out their opinion on the matter and justify their perspective, and respond to any other participant's concerns.</li>
<li> The discussions should continue long enough to include any prominent aspect of the ICE activities that has appeared in the news, giving each participant an opportunity to weigh in.</li>
<li> Issues should be introduced to the discussion organically.</li>
<li> If the discussion gets off track, a moderator will intervene, but the moderator will never prevent an issue of relevance from being fully explored.</li>
<li> At the end of the discussion, the moderator will try to summarize in general terms, the positions of the participants.</li>
<li> The moderator will summarize any areas of overlap or agreement.</li>
<li> The moderator will determine if there is any obvious common ground among the participants.</li>
<li> The moderator will highlight any irreconcilable points.</li>
<li> The moderator will ask the panelists if these observations sound fair to all of them.</li>
<li> Finally, the moderator will ask each panelist whether they believe a moderate, centrist position exists on this issue where participants could coexist, and what changes it would take to get there.</li>

## The Discussion

**MODERATOR:** Good afternoon, everyone. Today we're examining the recent escalation of ICE enforcement operations under the Trump administration's "Operation At Large" and related policies. Let's begin with each participant sharing their primary concerns about current ICE activities.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** Thank you. My biggest concern is the unprecedented scale and scope of these operations. We're seeing ICE arrest quotas of 3,000 people daily, involving over 5,000 federal personnel and potentially 21,000 National Guard troops. This isn't targeted enforcement of dangerous criminals—it's mass deportation that's tearing apart families and communities. The \$170 billion budget allocation represents a 265% increase in detention funding, creating what amounts to the largest detention system in U.S. history.[^1_1][^1_2]

**JAKE HARRISON:** I share concerns about the scale, but from a different angle. The deployment of 21,000 National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement operations fundamentally violates the Posse Comitatus Act's spirit. We're seeing federal agents from the FBI, DEA, and IRS being pulled from their primary missions to assist ICE. This militarization of immigration enforcement threatens our constitutional framework and diverts resources from actual national security threats.[^1_3][^1_4][^1_1]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** As someone who's worked in enforcement, I understand the need for immigration law enforcement. But what troubles me is the shift away from prioritizing dangerous criminals toward mass arrests of anyone without status. When I was with ICE, we focused on individuals with serious criminal records. Now we're seeing collateral arrests at grocery stores and bus stops, which undermines community trust that took years to build.[^1_5]

**REV. THOMPSON:** From a moral perspective, we're witnessing a humanitarian crisis. ICE has eliminated protections for sensitive locations, meaning agents can now arrest people at churches, schools, and hospitals. I've seen families afraid to bring sick children to medical care or attend religious services. When a government creates fear that prevents people from seeking spiritual comfort or medical attention, we've lost our moral compass.[^1_6]

**MODERATOR:** Let's examine the sanctuary cities issue that's generated significant controversy.

**JAKE HARRISON:** The sanctuary city debate perfectly illustrates constitutional overreach from both sides. While I support immigration enforcement, the federal government cannot commandeer state and local resources. States have the right to decide how their police forces operate. If ICE wants to enforce federal law, they should use federal resources, not coerce states through funding threats.[^1_7][^1_8]

**DR. MARTINEZ:** Exactly. Sanctuary policies aren't about harboring criminals—they're about public safety. When immigrant communities trust local police enough to report crimes and serve as witnesses, everyone benefits. ICE's courthouse arrests are particularly destructive, deterring people from participating in the justice system and making entire communities less safe.[^1_9][^1_10]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** I appreciate the constitutional concerns, but we can't ignore that some sanctuary policies have protected individuals with serious criminal records. The case of Rolando Ico-Choc, who was arrested repeatedly for DUIs and domestic violence but couldn't be transferred to federal custody due to sanctuary laws, resulted in an innocent person's death. There has to be middle ground where we protect families but don't shield dangerous criminals.[^1_11]

**REV. THOMPSON:** But Maria, the vast majority of people being arrested aren't dangerous criminals. The American people oppose arrests in schools and places of worship by a 6-to-1 margin. When we create policies based on extreme cases, we end up causing more harm than good. Operation Guardian Angel may have found a legal workaround with judicial warrants, but it's still targeting people for administrative violations, not violent crimes.[^1_12][^1_6]

**MODERATOR:** The detention system expansion has raised significant concerns. What are your thoughts on the \$45 billion allocated for new facilities?

**DR. MARTINEZ:** This detention expansion is unconscionable. We're creating a system designed to hold over 100,000 people daily—larger than the entire federal prison system. The medical neglect and deaths in ICE custody are well-documented. In 88% of the 52 deaths reviewed, ICE medical staff made incorrect diagnoses. We're essentially building concentration camps for civil immigration violations.[^1_2][^1_13][^1_14][^1_15]

**JAKE HARRISON:** The private prison aspect is particularly troubling. Companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic are profiting from human misery while taxpayers fund their operations. This creates perverse incentives where corporations benefit from keeping more people detained longer. It's corporate welfare disguised as law enforcement.[^1_13]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** While I agree conditions need improvement, calling them concentration camps is inflammatory and historically inaccurate. However, the death rate concerns are valid. With 12 deaths already this fiscal year matching last year's total, we clearly need better medical oversight. The problem isn't detention itself—it's the quality of care and the focus on detention over alternatives to detention.[^1_16]

**REV. THOMPSON:** When people die in custody from preventable causes like undiagnosed pneumonia or heart attacks because medical staff are texting instead of monitoring patients, we have a moral crisis. These are human beings, not statistics. The expansion means more preventable deaths, more family separations, more children growing up without parents.[^1_15]

**MODERATOR:** Let's address the workplace raids and their economic impact.

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** Workplace enforcement serves important purposes—it deters unauthorized employment and levels the playing field for law-abiding employers. When businesses knowingly hire undocumented workers, they undercut wages for everyone and exploit vulnerable people. Strategic I-9 audits can be effective without the militaristic approach of mass raids.

**JAKE HARRISON:** But the economic disruption is massive. These raids often target industries like agriculture and construction that depend on immigrant labor. When you remove workers en masse without addressing the underlying demand for their labor, you create supply chain disruptions that hurt consumers and legitimate businesses. It's economically destructive policy.[^1_5]

**DR. MARTINEZ:** The workplace raids also facilitate wage theft and labor exploitation. Employers who violate labor laws often escape consequences while workers get deported. ICE raids sometimes occur right after Department of Labor investigations, effectively protecting criminal employers by removing the witnesses to their crimes. It's backwards.[^1_17]

**REV. THOMPSON:** I've counseled families torn apart by workplace raids. Children coming home to find parents missing, not knowing if they'll ever see them again. The Ambiance Apparel raid in Los Angeles is typical—massive show of force that terrorizes entire communities. The human cost of these operations far outweighs any enforcement benefit.[^1_18]

**MODERATOR:** How do you assess the constitutional challenges being raised?

**JAKE HARRISON:** The Fourth Amendment violations are clear. Administrative warrants shouldn't allow ICE agents to enter homes or detain people without judicial oversight. The Supreme Court case on roving ICE raids is crucial—we can't allow law enforcement to conduct stops based solely on race or ethnicity. Constitutional protections apply to everyone on U.S. soil, regardless of immigration status.[^1_19][^1_20]

**DR. MARTINEZ:** The due process violations are systematic. Expedited removal procedures deny people basic hearings, and ICE's targeting of people at courthouses punishes those who comply with legal processes. When people are afraid to appear in court because they might be arrested, the entire justice system breaks down.[^1_10][^1_21]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** While I support constitutional protections, we can't ignore that immigration enforcement is inherently different from criminal law enforcement. Administrative violations don't require the same procedural protections as criminal cases. The challenge is finding the right balance between effective enforcement and due process rights.

**REV. THOMPSON:** But when people die in custody or are deported without proper hearings, those constitutional protections become meaningless. The Alien Enemies Act from 1798 shouldn't be used to bypass modern constitutional standards. We've evolved as a society since then.[^1_20]

**MODERATOR:** What about the National Guard deployment for immigration enforcement?

**JAKE HARRISON:** This is where I draw a hard line. Using military personnel for domestic law enforcement violates fundamental American principles. The Posse Comitatus Act exists for good reason—we don't want military forces conducting civilian policing. Having National Guard troops collecting DNA samples and fingerprinting detainees is inappropriate militarization of immigration policy.[^1_3]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** The administrative support role makes sense given ICE's resource constraints. If National Guard personnel are handling paperwork and transportation, that frees ICE agents for actual enforcement duties. As long as they're not directly conducting arrests, it could be a reasonable force multiplier.[^1_3]

**DR. MARTINEZ:** But it normalizes the use of military forces against civilian populations. When children see soldiers at ICE facilities, it sends a message that immigrants are enemy combatants, not people seeking better lives. It's psychological warfare against vulnerable communities.

**REV. THOMPSON:** The optics are terrible. When a democracy deploys military forces against its own residents, even in administrative roles, it resembles authoritarian regimes. It sends the wrong message about American values to the world and to our own children.

**MODERATOR:** Let's discuss the border wall funding and its effectiveness.

**JAKE HARRISON:** The \$46.6 billion for border wall construction is fiscal irresponsibility on a massive scale. Previous studies show walls don't significantly reduce immigration—they just push it to different locations. This is pork-barrel spending that enriches contractors while wasting taxpayer money. Even Texas, which built only 8% of its planned wall, is quietly defunding the program.[^1_22][^1_23][^1_24]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** Physical barriers can be effective in specific locations with proper monitoring technology. The issue isn't walls per se, but the lack of comprehensive strategy. Without addressing the root causes of migration or the demand for immigrant labor, walls alone won't solve anything. The money would be better spent on technology and personnel.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** The environmental destruction from wall construction is devastating. We're destroying fragile desert ecosystems, disrupting wildlife migration patterns, and desecrating indigenous sacred sites. The wall is more symbolic than practical—it's about sending a message of exclusion rather than solving immigration challenges.[^1_24]

**REV. THOMPSON:** From a moral standpoint, walls represent fear and division rather than hope and welcome. They contradict the biblical mandate to welcome strangers and care for the vulnerable. We're spending billions to keep out people fleeing poverty and violence instead of addressing why they're leaving their homes.

**MODERATOR:** What role should state and local law enforcement play in immigration enforcement?

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** The 287(g) program can work when properly implemented. Local officers who receive immigration enforcement training can identify dangerous criminals who might otherwise slip through the cracks. The key is focusing on genuine public safety threats, not broad immigration enforcement.[^1_25]

**JAKE HARRISON:** State and local police should focus on their core mission—public safety. When they become immigration enforcers, immigrant communities stop cooperating with police, making everyone less safe. The 287(g) program has grown from 135 to 628 agreements, which is massive mission creep for local law enforcement.[^1_25]

**DR. MARTINEZ:** The expansion of 287(g) agreements is creating a deportation machine at the local level. Police officers aren't immigration experts, and this program leads to racial profiling and constitutional violations. Communities need police they can trust, not federal immigration agents in local uniforms.

**REV. THOMPSON:** When local police become immigration enforcers, families are afraid to call 911 during emergencies or report crimes they witness. This makes communities more dangerous for everyone. Public safety requires community trust, which these programs destroy.

**MODERATOR:** How do you evaluate ICE's current priorities and targeting?

**DR. MARTINEZ:** The shift from prioritizing serious criminals to mass arrests of anyone without status represents a fundamental change in enforcement philosophy. Under previous administrations, ICE focused resources on individuals with violent criminal records. Now they're arresting grandmothers at grocery stores and parents dropping children at school.[^1_5]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** There's merit to removing all individuals who have received final removal orders, regardless of criminal history. Immigration laws exist for a reason, and selective enforcement undermines the rule of law. However, the collateral arrests of people with no criminal record during these operations create unnecessary fear and family separation.

**JAKE HARRISON:** The resource allocation is completely backwards. We're pulling FBI agents from counterterrorism and organized crime investigations to help ICE arrest people for civil immigration violations. This makes us less safe from genuine national security threats while wasting resources on administrative infractions.[^1_1]

**REV. THOMPSON:** When ICE arrests people at hospitals seeking medical care or parents attending their children's school events, they're punishing people for engaging in normal human activities. This creates a climate of fear that affects entire communities, including U.S. citizens who look like they might be immigrants.

**MODERATOR:** What are your thoughts on the human impact of these policies?

**REV. THOMPSON:** I've buried children who died because their parents were too afraid to seek medical care after ICE raids in their community. I've counseled U.S. citizen children whose undocumented parents were deported, leaving them orphaned in effect. The trauma these policies inflict on children will have generational consequences.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** Mixed-status families are being destroyed. U.S. citizen children are losing parents, spouses are being separated, and communities that have existed for decades are being scattered. The psychological trauma, especially on children, creates long-term social costs that far exceed any enforcement benefits.[^1_5]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** While I understand the human impact, we can't ignore that immigration laws exist and have consequences. The challenge is implementing enforcement humanely while maintaining the integrity of the legal system. Family separation should be minimized, but people who entered illegally must understand there are consequences.

**JAKE HARRISON:** The scale of family separation we're seeing goes beyond normal law enforcement consequences. When enforcement actions break up more families than they protect communities from dangerous individuals, the policy is fundamentally flawed. Government power should be exercised with restraint and proportionality.

**MODERATOR:** Let's discuss potential solutions and reforms.

**JAKE HARRISON:** First, we need to right-size ICE operations. Remove non-ICE federal agents from immigration enforcement and return them to their primary missions. Focus ICE resources on individuals who pose genuine public safety or national security threats. Eliminate military involvement in domestic immigration enforcement. And most importantly, address the labor market demand that drives unauthorized immigration through legal guest worker programs.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** We need comprehensive immigration reform that provides pathways to legal status for long-term residents, especially those with U.S. citizen family members. Expand legal immigration opportunities to match economic demand. End the use of private detention facilities and implement alternatives to detention. Restore protections for sensitive locations and due process rights. Most fundamentally, treat this as a humanitarian issue, not a military operation.[^1_5]

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** Reform should maintain enforcement capability while improving humanity and efficiency. Focus detention resources on flight risks and public safety threats. Improve medical care and oversight in detention facilities. Expand cooperation with countries of origin to address root causes of migration. Streamline removal processes for those with final orders while protecting due process for others. Create clear, predictable enforcement priorities that communities can understand.

**REV. THOMPSON:** Address the root causes of migration through foreign aid and trade policies that create opportunities in source countries. Expand refugee and asylum processing capacity to provide legal pathways for people fleeing violence. Create a truth and reconciliation process to acknowledge the harm done to immigrant communities and begin healing. Most importantly, remember that these are human beings created in God's image, deserving of dignity and compassion.

**MODERATOR:** Are there areas where you find common ground?

**ALL PARTICIPANTS:** *[Agreement across the panel]*

- Focus enforcement resources on individuals who pose genuine public safety threats
- Improve medical care and conditions in detention facilities
- Protect children from enforcement actions
- Address root causes of migration in source countries
- Maintain constitutional protections and due process rights
- Separate immigration enforcement from local community policing
- Reduce family separations when possible

**MODERATOR:** What about irreconcilable differences?

**DR. MARTINEZ:** I cannot accept mass deportation of long-term residents with U.S. citizen family members as morally justifiable or practically feasible.

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** I cannot support sanctuary policies that prevent the transfer of dangerous criminals to federal custody for removal.

**JAKE HARRISON:** I cannot support the militarization of domestic immigration enforcement or the use of federal coercion against state and local governments.

**REV. THOMPSON:** I cannot accept policies that prevent people from seeking medical care, attending religious services, or sending children to school without fear of arrest.

**MODERATOR:** Is there a centrist position where you could coexist?

**JAKE HARRISON:** A limited government approach focused on genuine security threats, constitutional protections, and market-based solutions for labor needs could work. Keep enforcement targeted, respect state rights, and create legal pathways for needed workers.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** I could accept enhanced enforcement against serious criminals if coupled with legalization opportunities for long-term residents, protection for families, and restoration of due process rights. But mass deportation is non-negotiable.

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** A system that consistently enforces laws against dangerous individuals while providing humanitarian relief for families and children could work. Clear, predictable priorities that focus resources efficiently.

**REV. THOMPSON:** I could support targeted enforcement of serious criminals if balanced by comprehensive protection for vulnerable populations, especially children, and significant expansion of legal pathways to status. But never at the expense of basic human dignity.

**MODERATOR:** Based on our discussion, there appears to be narrow common ground around targeted enforcement of serious criminals, constitutional protections, humane treatment in detention, and family unity principles. However, fundamental disagreements remain about mass deportation, sanctuary policies, enforcement priorities, and the appropriate scale and scope of immigration enforcement operations.

**ALL PARTICIPANTS:** *[Nodding agreement with the moderator's assessment]*

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for this thoughtful discussion. While significant differences remain, your willingness to engage respectfully across ideological lines demonstrates that productive dialogue on even contentious issues remains possible in American democracy.

<div><p>I thought a couple of things were interesting. First, for the two empty seats, the LLM did not choose an extreme viewpoint representative. I will let you decide whether the four participants (a liberal Democrat  immigration rights attorney, a libertarian small business owner and former military officer, a conservative independent former ICE agent, and a progressive faith healer) were a fair set of choices.</p>

<p>And the participants did appear to find common ground on a list of seven different aspects of ICE enforcement. One possible criticism: I don't see the suggestion to "abolish ICE" represented here, though I did ask the AI whether anyone aligned with the idea of abolishing ICE, and it suggested:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Dr. Sarah Martinez</i> and <i>Rev. David Thompson</i> are the most likely "abolish ICE" supporters among the scripted participants, joined in sympathy by the most left-leaning focus group voters. Others either oppose or reject the sentiment.</p><p>[...] Dr. Sarah Martinez (Liberal Democrat immigration advocate) would be most likely to agree with the sentiment "abolish ICE," or at least strongly support drastically reducing or fundamentally reforming ICE. Her focus on family separation, humanitarian harm, and systemic abuses aligns with the Abolish ICE movement seen in progressive circles. She may explicitly support abolition or advocate for replacing ICE with a different, more humane system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since there was no enthusiastic support among the roundtable participants, I prompted the AI to speak from the point of view of an administration surrogate, and it took my prompt quite literally and decided to hand-puppet Stephen Miller. I added "LLM" to the name to stress a distinction, and elaborate in this disclaimer:</p>

# Follow-Up Interview with Trump Administration Surrogate

## Introduction

**MODERATOR:** Joining us now is **Stephen LLM Miller**, Senior Advisor to President Trump and architect of the administration's immigration enforcement strategy. Mr. Miller previously served as a senior aide to Senator Jeff Sessions and has been a key figure in developing the "America First" immigration agenda since the first Trump administration. He holds degrees from Duke University and has been instrumental in crafting policies including the travel ban, family separation protocols, and the current "Operation At Large" enforcement surge. Mr. Miller, thank you for joining us.

**LLM MILLER:** Thank you for having me. I'm glad to have the opportunity to respond to the claims made by your panel and set the record straight on the administration's lawful and necessary immigration enforcement policies.

***

## Initial Response

**MODERATOR:** What stood out to you most from the roundtable discussion we just heard?

**LLM MILLER:** What stood out most was the complete disconnect from reality displayed by several participants. Dr. Martinez calling our detention facilities "concentration camps" is not only historically offensive but factually absurd. These are modern facilities providing medical care, legal services, and humane treatment to individuals who violated our immigration laws. The comparison trivializes actual historical atrocities.[^2_1][^2_2]

More fundamentally, what I heard was a complete rejection of the rule of law. The American people voted for immigration enforcement, not selective amnesty for lawbreakers. When Rev. Thompson says people are "afraid to seek medical care," that's a choice they're making—no one is preventing legal residents from accessing services. The fear comes from being in the country illegally, not from our enforcement actions.

Jake Harrison's constitutional concerns are misguided. The President has plenary power over immigration enforcement, and using all available federal resources, including the National Guard in administrative roles, is both legal and necessary. The scale of the crisis requires a proportional response.[^2_3][^2_4]

**MODERATOR:** The participants expressed concerns about the \$170 billion budget increase and detention expansion. How do you respond to those cost concerns?

**LLM MILLER:** This is an investment in America's sovereignty and security. The cost of illegal immigration—in education, healthcare, criminal justice, and social services—far exceeds our enforcement budget. Every dollar spent on removal saves taxpayers multiple dollars in prevented future costs. The detention expansion is necessary because we inherited a system where 90% of asylum seekers with final removal orders simply disappeared into the country. We're ending catch-and-release permanently.[^2_5]

The private detention partnerships allow us to scale capacity quickly and cost-effectively. Government-run facilities would be far more expensive and bureaucratic. These contracts include strict oversight and medical standards that exceed many state prison systems.

## Challenging Questions

**MODERATOR:** Let's address some specific conflicts with the participants' views. Maria Santos-Chen, your former ICE agent, argued that collateral arrests of non-criminals undermine community trust. How do you respond to law enforcement professionals who say this approach is counterproductive?

**LLM MILLER:** With respect to Ms. Santos-Chen, this represents the old thinking that failed America for decades. The "prioritization" policies of previous administrations created a culture where immigration law was treated as optional. When you only enforce laws against certain people, you're not enforcing the law at all—you're choosing who gets to violate it with impunity.

Every illegal alien has violated federal law. The idea that we should ignore some lawbreakers while pursuing others sends the message that our laws don't matter. This is precisely why we have 11-15 million people in the country illegally—because previous administrations signaled that immigration law is negotiable.

**MODERATOR:** The participants found common ground on protecting children from enforcement actions. Yet ICE has eliminated sensitive location protections for schools and hospitals. Can you explain this policy change?

**LLM MILLER:** The sensitive locations policy was exploited to create de facto sanctuary zones throughout America. Criminals would flee to schools and hospitals knowing they were immune from arrest. We've seen drug dealers and gang members use these policies to evade justice.

That said, we're not targeting children—we're removing parents who brought children into untenable situations by entering illegally. The responsibility for family disruption lies with the adults who chose to break our laws, not with the officers enforcing them. Children can accompany their parents when they're removed, keeping families together.

**MODERATOR:** Jake Harrison raised constitutional concerns about using National Guard troops and pulling FBI agents from other duties. How do you address these federalism and resource allocation concerns?

**LLM MILLER:** The Constitution gives the federal government exclusive authority over immigration. States that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement are violating the Supremacy Clause. We're not asking states to enforce immigration law—we're asking them to stop obstructing federal enforcement.[^2_3]

As for federal resources, immigration enforcement IS national security. Every FBI agent helping ICE is protecting America from invasion. The Drug Enforcement Administration agents are stopping fentanyl dealers who are disproportionately foreign nationals. This represents smart resource allocation, not mission creep.[^2_6]

**MODERATOR:** Dr. Martinez cited statistics showing 88% of detention deaths involved medical misdiagnosis. How does the administration address these healthcare concerns while expanding detention capacity?

**LLM MILLER:** These facilities meet or exceed American Correctional Association standards. Every death in custody is tragic and investigated thoroughly. However, many detainees arrive with pre-existing medical conditions from their countries of origin. We've actually improved medical screening and care compared to previous administrations.

The expansion includes new medical facilities and increased healthcare staffing. Private contractors bring expertise and efficiency that government operations lack. The alternative—releasing everyone into the country—would create far more humanitarian problems and deaths.[^2_2]

## Middle Ground and Policy Flexibility

**MODERATOR:** Several participants suggested focusing enforcement on serious criminals while providing pathways to legal status for long-term residents with U.S. citizen family members. Is there any middle ground the administration would consider?

**LLM MILLER:** The administration's position is clear: we enforce all immigration laws fairly and consistently. "Comprehensive immigration reform" is code for amnesty, which rewards lawbreaking and encourages more illegal immigration. We tried amnesty in 1986—it failed catastrophically and led to the current crisis.

However, we support merit-based legal immigration expansion. People who want to come to America legally should have opportunities through skills-based visas and guest worker programs. But those who cut in line by entering illegally cannot be rewarded with the same outcome as legal immigrants.

**MODERATOR:** Are there any aspects of current policy the administration might modify based on implementation experience or changing circumstances?

**LLM MILLER:** The President is always evaluating operational effectiveness, but the core principles are non-negotiable: secure borders, interior enforcement, and respect for the rule of law. We might adjust tactics—using different detention facilities, varying operational schedules, or modifying cooperation agreements—but the strategic direction won't change.

The only "changes" we'd consider are making enforcement more efficient and comprehensive, not less. If anything, we're exploring expanding expedited removal procedures and reducing bureaucratic delays in the removal process.[^2_7]

**MODERATOR:** How would you recommend the roundtable participants modify their views to better align with the administration's approach?

**LLM MILLER:** They need to accept that immigration law exists and must be enforced. Dr. Martinez should acknowledge that providing legal pathways for lawbreakers undermines legal immigration. Rev. Thompson should recognize that enforcing laws isn't immoral—it's essential for a functioning society.

Jake Harrison's libertarian principles should lead him to support immigration enforcement, because open borders are incompatible with limited government. You cannot have unlimited immigration and limited government social services.

Maria Santos-Chen is closest to understanding operational realities, but she needs to embrace comprehensive enforcement rather than selective prioritization. Half-measures failed for forty years.

## Participants' Final Comments

**MODERATOR:** I'd like to give each roundtable participant one final comment to Mr. Miller based on his responses.

**DR. MARTINEZ:** Mr. Miller, your policies are creating a generation of traumatized American children who are losing parents to deportation. When U.S. citizen children grow up afraid of their government, afraid to call police, afraid to seek medical care, you're not making America great—you're making it cruel. History will judge these policies harshly.

**JAKE HARRISON:** Stephen, you're fundamentally misunderstanding constitutional limits on federal power. The President doesn't have "plenary power" to commandeer state resources or use military forces for domestic law enforcement. These precedents you're setting will be used by future Democratic presidents in ways you won't like. Constitutional principles matter more than political outcomes.

**MARIA SANTOS-CHEN:** I appreciate your commitment to enforcement, but I've seen what works and what doesn't in the field. Mass arrests without criminal targeting create community backlash that makes everyone less safe. Smart enforcement focuses resources where they matter most—on genuine threats, not families trying to survive.

**REV. THOMPSON:** Mr. Miller, when children die because parents are afraid to seek medical care after ICE raids, that blood is on all our hands. When you eliminate sanctuary at hospitals and churches, you're attacking the sacred responsibility to care for the vulnerable. No law is more important than preventing preventable suffering and death.

**LLM MILLER:** I appreciate the participants' passion, but emotion cannot override law. Dr. Martinez, parents who entered illegally created the situation their children face—not our enforcement. Jake, the Constitution gives the federal government exclusive authority over immigration, and we'll use every legal tool to protect American sovereignty. Maria, comprehensive enforcement IS smart enforcement—selective enforcement is what failed. And Reverend, the most moral thing we can do is enforce laws consistently so people don't risk dangerous border crossings in the first place.

## Conclusion

**MODERATOR:** Finally, Mr. Miller, what do you believe will be the result of these ICE policies, and what do you expect America to look like four years from now?

**LLM MILLER:** Four years from now, America will have restored the rule of law on immigration. We'll have secure borders, reduced illegal immigration by 90%, and eliminated the criminal organizations that profit from human smuggling. American workers will see rising wages as labor markets tighten, and communities will be safer without the criminal elements that exploit immigration chaos.[^2_8]

Most importantly, we'll have restored respect for legal immigration. When people know they must follow the law to come here, legal immigrants will be welcomed and integrated successfully. The lawlessness and chaos of the past four decades will be replaced by order, security, and respect for American sovereignty.

We're not anti-immigrant—we're pro-American. Every nation has the right to control its borders and decide who becomes a member of its national community. These policies will restore that fundamental principle of sovereignty that makes democratic self-governance possible.

The participants represent the failed thinking that created this crisis. Our policies represent the solution America voted for and deserves.

**MODERATOR:** Mr. Miller, thank you for joining us and providing the administration's perspective on these critical issues.

**LLM MILLER:** Thank you for the opportunity to set the record straight.

<div><p>I think it's pretty notable that LLM Miller draws a line in the sand, essentially at the Administration's position. In the interest of full disclosure, I told the LLM that it couldn't allow LLM Miller to craft new policy on the fly, so it's not as though LLM Miller could actually change the administration's stance.</p>

<p>That said, this would still look quite a bit different if there was flexibility or room for compromise in the policy. It's absolutely clear that LLM Miller views the compromise ideas not as a middle ground, but a complete unraveling of the policy. My interpretation (and see if it matches your own) is that any sort of assistance for migrants encourages lawlessness.</p>

<p>It's also notable that this isn't the policy</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Dr. Sarah Martinez</i> and <i>Rev. David Thompson</i> are the most likely "abolish ICE" supporters among the scripted participants, joined in sympathy by the most left-leaning focus group voters. Others either oppose or reject the sentiment.</p><p>[...] Dr. Sarah Martinez (Liberal Democrat immigration advocate) would be most likely to agree with the sentiment "abolish ICE," or at least strongly support drastically reducing or fundamentally reforming ICE.

She may explicitly support abolition or advocate for replacing ICE with a different, more humane system.</p>

<p>In order to possibly get some more diverse reactions, I had the LLM come up with a 5-member focus group to react to what they had heard.</p>

# Post-Event Focus Group Discussion

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for watching both the roundtable discussion and the follow-up interview with Stephen LLM Miller. Let's hear your reactions. I'll start with Patricia.

**PATRICIA** *(Registered Republican, voted Trump 2024)*: Honestly, Stephen LLM Miller was the only one making sense. The roundtable participants were all bleeding hearts who don't understand that laws exist for a reason. When that minister talked about people being afraid to go to hospitals, I thought - well, maybe they shouldn't be here illegally in the first place. Miller was right that we tried amnesty before and it failed. I'm tired of my tax dollars going to people who cut in line while my neighbor waited eight years to bring his wife here legally.

**MODERATOR:** Carlos, your thoughts?

**CARLOS** *(Registered Democrat, voted Harris 2024)*: That was honestly painful to watch. Miller's responses were exactly what I expected - zero empathy, zero understanding of what these families are going through. When Dr. Martinez talked about children dying because parents are afraid to seek medical care, and Miller basically shrugged it off, that told me everything I need to know. The roundtable showed real people grappling with complex issues. Miller just spouted talking points about "invasion" and "sovereignty." It was dehumanizing.

**MODERATOR:** James, what was your reaction?

**JAMES** *(Registered Independent, voted Kennedy/West 2024)*: The whole thing reinforced why I'm independent. Both sides are living in different realities. The roundtable folks had valid concerns about constitutional overreach and family separation, but they seemed naive about enforcement realities. Miller was articulate about legal authority but completely tone-deaf about human impact. What struck me was how Jake Harrison, the libertarian, probably made the most sense about constitutional limits, but everyone else just talked past each other.

**MODERATOR:** Sandra, your perspective?

**SANDRA** *(Registered Republican, voted Haley in primary, reluctantly Trump 2024)*: I'm conflicted. I do think we need border security and immigration enforcement - that's why I voted Republican. But listening to that former ICE agent, Maria Santos-Chen, talk about how mass arrests of non-criminals undermine community trust really resonated with me. Miller dismissed her concerns, but she actually worked in enforcement. I want tough but smart policies, not just tough policies. The scale Miller was defending seems excessive and potentially counterproductive.

**MODERATOR:** And Maria, what did you think?

**MARIA** *(Registered Democrat, didn't vote 2024)*: I almost turned it off when Miller started talking. The roundtable was at least trying to find solutions and acknowledge complexity. Miller just kept saying "rule of law" like it's some magic phrase that justifies anything. When the minister said children are dying and Miller basically said that's their parents' fault for being here illegally - that's when you know someone has lost their humanity. I didn't vote because I felt hopeless about our politics, and this just confirms why.

**MODERATOR:** Who do you think made the strongest case? Patricia?

**PATRICIA:** Miller, hands down. He had facts, legal authority, and didn't get emotional. The roundtable was all feelings and sob stories. Miller explained why previous approaches failed and why this administration's approach will work.

**CARLOS:** Dr. Martinez made the strongest case by far. She had data about family separations, detention deaths, constitutional violations. She understood both the human cost and the legal issues. Miller just repeated campaign slogans.

**JAMES:** Jake Harrison impressed me most. He approached it from constitutional principles rather than partisan talking points. His concerns about militarization and federal overreach were well-founded and came from a consistent philosophy, not political convenience.

**SANDRA:** I thought Maria Santos-Chen was most credible because she had actual enforcement experience. She wasn't anti-enforcement like some others, but she understood what actually works versus what just looks tough. Miller dismissed her expertise, which bothered me.

**MARIA:** Rev. Thompson spoke truth to power. When he talked about families being afraid to attend church or take kids to school, that's real America, not Miller's abstract legal theories. The minister connected policy to actual human suffering.

**MODERATOR:** Do you think there's middle ground all sides could agree on?

**PATRICIA:** The only middle ground would be if Democrats accepted that immigration laws have to be enforced. But they won't, so no. Miller was right - you can't negotiate with people who think any enforcement is cruel.

**CARLOS:** There could be middle ground if Republicans cared about anything other than cruelty. Focus on serious criminals, protect families, improve conditions - that's reasonable. But Miller rejected all of it. Hard to find middle ground with someone who calls detention facilities "humane" when people are dying in them.

**JAMES:** Maybe, but it would require both sides dropping their most extreme positions. Republicans would have to accept that mass deportation isn't practical or constitutional. Democrats would have to accept that immigration laws need enforcement. Neither side seems willing to compromise.

**SANDRA:** I think the roundtable participants found some common ground - focus on dangerous criminals, protect children, improve detention conditions. But Miller rejected all of it. The administration doesn't seem interested in middle ground, which is frustrating for voters like me who want effective but humane policies.

**MARIA:** What middle ground? Miller made it clear the administration thinks any compromise is weakness. When one side sees immigrants as human beings and the other sees them as invaders, where's the middle ground? You can't split the difference between compassion and cruelty.

**MODERATOR:** Thank you all for your thoughtful reactions. It's clear this issue continues to reveal deep divisions in how Americans view immigration, enforcement, and our national values.

*[End of Focus Group]*

The focus group responses reflect the polarized nature of immigration politics, with participants' reactions largely correlating with their partisan affiliations while revealing some cross-cutting concerns about effectiveness, constitutionality, and human impact.
