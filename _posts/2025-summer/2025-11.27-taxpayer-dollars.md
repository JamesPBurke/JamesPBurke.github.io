When a rich CEO does something with the company's money, and you are a customer of that business, have you ever noticed that nobody ever says "look what that CEO did with my consumer dollars!" The CEO, who is als paid with those dollars, may find people discussing how his money is spent, but have you noticed that we never seem to focus on the fact that it's our "customer dollars" that he's doing something nutty with?

Yet it's become common to refer to "taxpayer dollars" and "our tax money" when referring to how the government's treasury is spent.
