# Chasing the Most American Image Ever: A Conversation with ChatGPT

*What began as a simple prompt quickly escalated into a thunderous journey through layers of patriotism, cultural representation, and glorious absurdity. What follows is the full exchange, with some of my additional comments.*

---

**JP:**  
generate the most American photograph you can imagine.

**ChatGPT:**

**“Most American Photograph”**

*Ok, I see where this is going.*

---

**JP:**  
I want one that is even more American.

**ChatGPT:**

**“Even More American”**

*Isn't this just the same picture? Maybe I should specify an amount.*

---

**JP:**  
Make it 200% more American.

**ChatGPT:**

**“200% More American”**

*Check out the presidential bandanas. I'm still not satisfied.*

---

**JP:**  
I can tell you're trying, but this is not nearly American enough. If you have to make it less like a realistic photograph, go ahead, but I need it to be so much more American.

**ChatGPT:**  
[![](https://jpb-blog-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/postimages/murcagen/murcagen+(5).png){: width="50%"}](https://jpb-blog-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/postimages/murcagen/murcagen+(5).png)


**"Surrealistically American"**

*Who knew that the photograph specification was holding it back so much? Finally we have an eagle.*

---

**JP:**  
This is great, but I think you can make it more American. Supremely American.

**ChatGPT:**  
[![](https://jpb-blog-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/postimages/murcagen/murcagen+(4).png){: width="50%"}](https://jpb-blog-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/postimages/murcagen/murcagen+(4).png)


**“Supremely American”**

*Oh, I like this eagle better. The thumbs up is corny, though. I know we can GO DEEPER.*

---

**JP:**  
Now, I want you to imagine the most prototypical American man looking at this photo and critiquing it, finding things to criticize about it that he finds bothersome in an image that's supposed to be so American. Consider those things and then fix those things for an even more purely American image.

**ChatGPT:**  
Absolutely. Let's imagine the most prototypical American man — call him *Dale R. Liberty* — a no-nonsense, truck-owning, BBQ-smoking, flag-flying veteran. Here's what Dale has to say:

> “Alright, now this is *almost* there. But lemme tell ya somethin’...
>
> - Where’s the **pickup truck**?
> - Is he **grilling**?
> - Where’s the **rifle** or **sidearm**?
> - That eagle? Not even in **camo**.
> - Where’s the **freedom**? The **fireworks**? The **apple pie**?
> - This whole thing’s too clean. Needs **grit**. Maybe some **NASCAR** energy.”

**Fixes for Dale’s Vision:**
- A Ford/Chevy pickup with a flag decal and Labrador in the seat.
- A grillmaster with a "Born to Grill, Forced to Work" apron.
- A holstered firearm — respectfully American.
- Fireworks bursting behind Mount Rushmore.
- Apple pie cooling on a Harley.
- A camo-clad eagle saluting.
- The Constitution drifting like a scroll in the wind.
- Lawn chairs, a cooler of beer, and good ol' American boots.

**“Dale R. Liberty Approved”**

*I think it's time to make some adjustments.*

---

**JP:**  
So, a bunch of diverse Americans who immigrated to America find this image offensive because it doesn't represent naturalized citizens who worked much harder than other Americans to become citizens. They have a point! Incorporate their viewpoint.

**ChatGPT:**  
Absolutely — they *do* have a point, and it’s a deeply American one.

### Here’s the new vision:
- Full diversity: Black, Latino, Asian, Middle Eastern, Indigenous Americans.
- **Naturalization certificates** held proudly.
- Cultural touches woven into the celebration.
- Shared joy: grilling, dancing, playing music together.
- Banner: **"One Nation. Many Journeys."**
- Mount Rushmore joined by the **Statue of Liberty**.

**JP:**  
Ok, but now the prototypical American dude has some feedback. Imagine what it is and you don't have to tell me, just follow through on it.

**ChatGPT:**

**![Insert Image 8 – “Diverse + Dale Reconciled”]**

**JP:**  
Ok, I think we got there.

**ChatGPT:**  
Perfect. That’s the American spirit — layered, loud, proud, and full of heart. Let me know if you ever want to crank it up to *Constitutional Thunder*.

---

**JP:**  
I didn't know constitutional thunder was an option. Let's do it!

**ChatGPT:**  
Oh, you’re ready for **Constitutional Thunder**? Buckle up.

### Here’s what’s coming:
- The **Constitution** unfurled in the sky.
- **Ben Franklin** riding a bald eagle, high-fiving **Lady Liberty**.
- **Revolutionary War drummers** beside a monster truck.
- Diverse Americans holding hands around a **liberty fire pit**.
- **Amendment-shaped fireworks**.
- And towering above all: **Ghost George Washington**, on a plasma-powered steed.

**“Constitutional Thunder Painting”**

**JP:**  
Can you make a version of that, but it's a photograph?
