Honestly, I'm not much of a believer in substituting ingredients specifically to make a recipe more healthy if what you're doing is trying to introduce micronutrients, especially if you're not really sure if the recipe will be compromised. 

Generally, I think it's easier to accomplish the same goals by eating foods that have those micronutrients. Like: eat the pancakes you like, and just later have some broccoli or whatever. Both in moderation, of course. I think a lot of people are so focused on micronutrients that they ignore the much more influential health effects of overeating (too many macronutrients) or lack of physical activity. I understand why: it gives you a feeling of control. And getting macros and exercise under control are hard. I sympathize. 

Prioritize, my friends. Do what you have to do to feel good about yourself, but understand that some details are going to get lost among the other habits. 

People used to joke (maybe still do) about someone ordering a diet soda in a fast food order.
