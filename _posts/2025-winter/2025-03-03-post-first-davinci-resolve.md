Here's a video I made yesterday using DaVinci Resolve. There's an explanation below.

Recently, I have moved my work from an older computer to a newer one, and I left my whole video editing rig behind. It seemed like a decent time to learn a new software system for video editing, and I chose to go with the free version of DaVinci Resolve. I haven't got any sort of revenue stream for making videos, so free seemed like a good price, and the previous software I was did have a "pay once" model, but recently changed to a subscription-based model, and so we parted ways.

I followed [this short tutorial,](https://youtu.be/SrJOE2pEp7A?si=evBtZ4dp4Uq0zCPW) which was enough to let me know how curring clips and transitioning them worked, along with some color grading.

My last software had a bunch of fancy built-in stuff, and some even fancier paid stuff, but I'm OK with slowly learnign this system for free and then moving to paid software if it ever becomes financially sensible to do so.
