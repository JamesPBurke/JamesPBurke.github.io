Back when I was first learnign MakeCode Arcade, I tried to write a mini-[clone of the arcade classic Sinistar](https://jamespburke.com/sinistar_arcade). At the time I'm making this blog post, it's largely incomplete. Sinistar comes right at you anstead of flying around. The world (universe?) doesn't wrap. It's not really the original game -- there's no collecting the little crystals, and there are no bouncy enemies or asteroids. And you have no weapons with which to fight Sinistar.

Most importantly, SInistar is lacking his signature menacing taunt in that growly voice of his. Which it can never have in MakeCode Arcade. But at least you can flee Sinistar. And he shoots menacing projectiles at you.

So, it's not so much Sinistar. But, hey, I'm not looking to get sued!
