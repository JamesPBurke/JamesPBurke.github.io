The other night I listended to a recent Ezra klein Show episode in which he interviewed Martin Gurri, and ex-CIA analyst
who wrote about how media had transformed into a force that created a kind of strong opposition effect that (and this is just my interpretation) creates a sort of pendulum effect in the government, sicne it had become so easy to expose scandalous things and create attacks.

Gurri's media theory is fascinating and does explain the last few elections, but I suspect the most important reason Klein chose this interviewee was that Gurri decided to vote for Trump in 2024. Based on Gurri's work, I'm guessing Klein saw an opportunity to have an interview with a thoughtful Trump voter. Reactions on Reddit were very critical; they were mostly appreciative of Klein's approach, but not kind to Gurri's answers to several of the lines of quesitoning. 

I listened to it in the middle of the night when I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep, and was drawn in by Gurri's confidence in the constellation of beliefs surrounding his "I'm not really a Trump supporter, but here's why I am digging what he's doing" attutude. Embarassingly, I'm a sucker for someone's narrative until I prick my finger on an obvious thorn.

And though it took me a day or so before the spell was almost completely broken, the moment I found that thorn was when Gurri, who has recently written an essay on USAID, downplayed the dismantling of the organization and denied the illegality of it on the basis that he wasn't familiar with its statuory origins which shouldn't yeild to an executive branch dismantling. To his credit, he wasn't adamant that it was a creation of the executive branch, but I don't think he believed the correction when Klein interjected. 

That was like the loose thread in a sweater. Over hours, a rosy view of government restructuring yeilded to
