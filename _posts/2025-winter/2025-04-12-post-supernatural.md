*The image above and the following explanation were created with ChatGPT for entertainment purposes. The narrative of the images above is as follows:*

# Panel 1

A student works quietly at a computer. Dr. Burke, masked and observant, stands nearby, calmly supervising the class. Everything seems normal... for now.

# Panel 2:

Suddenly, two students react in alarm—one gesturing toward the screen in panic. Emerging from the monitor is a shadowy, supernatural figure with glowing eyes. The class is clearly spooked, unsure what’s happening.

# Panel 3:

The shadowy figure looms over the student who summoned it—its presence unnerving but not outright violent. Dr. Burke, composed as ever, steps closer, assessing the situation without fear or panic.

# Panel 4:

Instead of escalating, the supernatural entity turns toward the group of students who look surprised but now more curious than frightened. Dr. Burke seems to be preparing to engage the figure in conversation, not confrontation.

# Panel 5:

Dr. Burke speaks calmly and directly to the shadowy being. His posture is open, suggesting he's seeking understanding rather than discipline. The entity seems receptive, no longer menacing.

# Panel 6:

Balance is restored. The students are back at work, the supernatural presence has vanished (or perhaps been welcomed as part of the classroom community). Dr. Burke stands in the foreground, mask on, giving a thumbs up. Order—and learning—has been restored.
