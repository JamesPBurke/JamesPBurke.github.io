# Sorry, but you're probably going to get pen posts. 


{% include figure popup=true image_path="https://ik.imagekit.io/scurryday/postimages/2025-april-pens.jpg?tr=w-1040" alt="a photo of some fountain pens" caption="These are some pens I dug up out of my collection, cleaned, and resurrected." %}

Recently -- at the beginning of April -- I was motivated to dig my fountain pens out oif the mess that is behind my work desk in the home office. I'd put fountain pens aside for a couple of reasons. A couple of months into the beginning of teaching high school, I lost a pen that I really liked. I also had slowed down in bullet journaling. 

For about seven years, I had been buying Moleskine or Piccadilly notebooks and filling them up with stuff like this:

![A sketch of a Photon robot I made in 2019.](https://ik.imagekit.io/scurryday/photonsketch.jpg?tr=w-1040)

But that was back when my existence was filled with meetings with other people exploring ideas and making decisions followed by reflection or work/writing time acting on the decisions made.

When I became a teacher, I looked back on my stacks of notebooks and wondered if I really needed them all. I started, instead, to take notes on an erasable notebook. The Rocketbook. I was a huge fan. I still am. You should check them out. I have a few of the different sizes. I still like the idea.

But I'm returning to the paper notebook. At least for now. I don't want to scan pages. With AI, it's now easy to scan handwriting, if I really need to. So I now have a decent reason to use fountain pens.

You'll likely get pen posts now and again. Maybe I'll write about a pen I like. Maybe I'll write about an ink I like. Maybe I'll write about what journaling is doing for me. Or about what I like about fountain pens. 

In time.
