<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">
You have your America, and I have mine.<br><br> 

You have your America of division, of walls seen and unseen,<br>
And I have my America of hearts open and burdens shared.<br><br>

You have your America, where power is measured by who is made to suffer,<br>
And I have my America, where lifting others is seen as strength.<br><br>

Your America looks at scarcity and fears that kindness is weakness,<br>
My America finds abundance in the belief that compassion is courage.<br><br>

Your America is a contest where one must lose for another to win,<br>
My America is a chorus of different voices, each striving to make a beautiful song.<br><br>

You see a nation of threats and of enemies in neighbors,<br>
I see a nation of dreams, of strangers becoming kin.<br><br>

Your America clenches fists and abandons those still outside the dream,<br>
My America reaches back, knowing justice is a road we still need to walk together.<br><br>

Your America admires the powerful and the privileged.<br>
My America grows arms that build and minds that seek,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Voices that teach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands that heal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts that dream.<br>

Your America is fleeting, built on grievance, anger, and fear.<br>
My America is enduring, rooted in hope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is imagined in many minds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is held aloft by many hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is waiting quietly in many hearts<br><br>

It will outlast the storms, the shadows, the voices that call for division.<br><br>


My America belongs to all who believe in one another.<br>
