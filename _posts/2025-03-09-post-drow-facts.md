That's right, the [Drow Facts](http://drowfacts.com) webapp is back. There's a story behind this. Here's the short version. The DrowFacts Project is something I threw together in basically a weekend's time after doing some training in App Inventor, and using some prior knowledge of JavaScript and a lot of Google searching. A whole two years before people started to be able to whip these things out using AI.

it was meant as a (lightly) educational project, but also as a place for me to record my own knowledge about this process so that I can remember what I did to get this working. And if you're interested, you can see what I did as well!

The site has its own domain ([drowfacts.com](http://drowfacts.com)) but you'll notice it's a redirect to this website. I've resurrected it after moving it here.

* Check out the [Drow Facts Wiki](https://github.com/JamesPBurke/drowfacts4u/wiki) for project details.
* The domain redirects to [https://jamespburke.com/drowfacts4u/](https://jamespburke.com/drowfacts4u/) -- so look for it there if the fancy domain name goes away.


One thing I'd like to arrange is to see if I can use a subfolder (an alternate repository on GitHub, as that's how this site is hosted) as its own webapp. I am not sure if the manifest system would interfere with the manifest I use for my main site. I plan to check that out soon. 

**UPDATE:** I got rid of the redirect and applied the domain as a custom domain, which allows https to work, which is a great improvement. Also, added a site manifest so that the first time you
visit the site on a mobile phone it should ask you if you want to install it like an app on your phone. So it's hosted on the web, but looks like an app.
