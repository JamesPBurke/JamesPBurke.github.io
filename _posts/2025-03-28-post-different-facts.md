When different ideological mindsets come with different facts, it's no longer a disagreement on mindsets because it becomes difficult or even impossible to find where the common ground is in a discussion. 

He's an example. Let's say you're upset about a new story because a distant cousin of yours is jailed without following the legal procedure that is supposed to protect them. You see a friend of a friend commenting on the story, so you wade in because you're afraid of the real world consequences not only for your distant cousin, but also for others. 

You try to contribute your concern to the exchange: we have laws, a constitution, etc. The FOAF doesn't engage with your contribution, instead repeating what they believe are facts that incriminate the distant cousin, which may or may not be true, but there's no way for you to verify them. Because, normally, a court proceeding would hash out these things. 

You try to refocus on the thing you believe is of concern to both of you: there is sure process that protects everyone living in our country. But your FOAF is immunized against engaging with your perspective by having been given a list of things they can say in response, which are designed to avoid engagement. 

You give up. The FOAF may or may not be interested in the process of the law. They are certainly not interested in discussing it. And you've lost interest. Something has driven such a wedge between you.

Let's look from the other perspective. Someone is making a comment about a news story that you're upset about. You perceive that they're uninformed about it because they're making some kind of legal argument that ignored the fact that the person in the story *did something wrong* that is *worsening our lives.* Somehow, they didn't see that someone had to do something about it. 

You try to tell them the things you know (and these are important things, you know, because they frighten you and they make it clear that this person in the story is wrong). Your friend's friend will not listen to you. It's clear they're brainwashed, or willingly misled by whatever media they're watching, which refuses to tell them about how this person in the story clearly did something wrong. You try again. Maybe they didn't get that people who do wrong things just shouldn't be allowed to be among us. Maybe they don't see that this is just the way things work, and we all follow the rules except for these people, so they've given up their claim to special treatment or empathy. This Facebook commenter needs to see how clear the answer is, and you get to lay out out, going back to the facts again. They're not listening.

Eventually, you are done with them. You can't make any progress, and you're so frustrated. You don't know why there are people like that, but you figure maybe they're just weak with empathy in a way that is endangering you and the people you love. If only they could see the facts that you see. 

This is a frustrating exchange. Hypothetical, yes, but not far off from some I've seen. These people aren't frustrated by the other's votes, but frustrated by how they can't even seem to communicate.

In part, this isn't a difference of perspective but a difference in values. I'm my study of the history of mathematics education, so many of the deep disagreements I saw were based on a difference of values. And when people could come together on an issue of education, it was usually ideologically different people finding common values, not a common perspective. Having two sets of facts helps to set up a fundamental clash of values, because the facts you're being served will speak to the danger you see in the threat to what you value. Eliminating expertise and eliminating processes of justification within the disciplines that study those areas paves the way for the notion that there is no difference between one supposed fact and another. 

It's no longer effective, I think, to ask people to try a change of perspective. Even in this comment, I'm appealing to the value of expertise. My perspective rests on that. If you believe there isn't anything special a person gains from years of experience and study, your values are different and it's really easy to dismiss what I'm saying. You might appeal to "common sense" which, it turns out, is based on having a set of facts that you've accepted.
