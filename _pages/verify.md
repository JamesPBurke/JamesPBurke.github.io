## üìú Past Key Migration Notice

I previously used a Keybase-managed PGP key with the fingerprint:

`f49117aa398befe31ee97c1dd9ea38d7db385371`

Because Keybase is no longer awesome, I transitioned to the independently controlled key listed above.

- üìÑ [Migration statement signed with my previous key (migration.txt.asc)](/verify/migration.txt.asc)
- üîó Also available on [Keybase public folder](keybase://public/sciuridae67/migration.txt.asc)

After signing my current key with the old key, I revoked the old key and removed it from Keybase, replacing it with my new key to reduce possible confusion and make it easier to contact/verify me. However, this page is the definitive source.
