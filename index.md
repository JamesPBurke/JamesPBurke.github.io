I am a **Digital Literacy Computer and Science classroom teacher**, a former software engineer, and MathEd postdoctoral research fellow. I believe in 
- playful STEM learning
- love of family and friends
- cooking
- sourdough
- sci-fi
- horror
- making things
- that intellect & romance should triumph over brute force & cynicism

Masks save lives.
